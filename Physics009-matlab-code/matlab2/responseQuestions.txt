Submission guidelines
Submit all your codes. You can choose to have codes for 2, 3, 4 and 5 in a single file. 
Make sure to comment well. Write up your results for 2, 3, 4 and 5 in a word file, 
which you will also submit. Specify what dx was used, and the value of the integral obtained using MATLAB's trapz function
(for (1)) or using integral calculus (for the other questions). Talk about how the choice of dx affects the value of the integral
for 2. Also talk about your result for 4 in the context of odd and even functions 
(Note that using MATLAB's trapz function in 2 is merely serving as a check as to whether your function for the trapezoidal rule is accurate or not.).


My Responses
The choice of dx is important.  Smaller and smaller values yields more accurate results
because we are adding up more and more smaller trapezoids.  If we use an infinitesimal amount
of trapezoids, the area estimate becomes exact.

For the even and odd functions, cos(x) is an even function and sin(x) is an odd function.  
Since sin(x) is an odd function, it becomes negative from -pi/2 to 0 and is positive from 0 to pi/2.
The area of sin(x) from -pi/2 to 0 and 0 to pi/2 are equal but opposite in sign, so they end up
canceling each other out to a really small number close to zero, if not zero.
Since cos(x) is an even function, it doubles from -pi/2 to pi/2.
